## 🌟 Abstract

We present **RynnWorld-4D**, a novel 4D embodied world model that shifts the paradigm from 2D pixel prediction to physically grounded 4D scene evolution. By co-generating synchronized RGB, depth, and optical flow (RGB-DF), RynnWorld-4D captures the underlying 3D geometry and temporal motion trajectories, creating a representation space that effectively bridges the gap between generative world modeling and low-level robotic control. We release RynnWorld-4D as a unified diffusion framework featuring a specialized tri-branch architecture, alongside **RynnWorld-4D-Policy** (an inverse dynamics head for high-frequency, closed-loop bimanual manipulation).

### 🌟 Key Highlights

- **Projective 4D Representation** — Integrates RGB, Depth, and Optical Flow into a unified RGB-DF format, allowing pixels to be unprojected into metric 3D scene flow for precise geometric and kinetic grounding.
- **Tri-branch Diffusion Architecture** — Employs three dedicated transformer branches with mutual cross-modal attention, ensuring that appearance, geometry, and motion evolve with high spatio-temporal consistency.
- **Action-from-Latent Policy** — RynnWorld-4D-Policy bypasses expensive multi-step denoising by directly consuming internal 4D latents, enabling high-frequency (9 Hz+), closed-loop dexterous control.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🔧 Environment Setup

#### Pixi (recommended for CUDA 12.8 / Blackwell)

This fork includes a locked [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) environment for Python 3.10
and CUDA 12.8-compatible PyTorch packages:

```bash
# Install Pixi once if it is not already available.
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh

# Reopen the shell if needed, then create the locked project environment.
pixi install --locked
pixi run verify
```

The verification task is CPU-safe and does not initialize CUDA. When a GPU is
available to the process, verify the CUDA runtime separately:

```bash
pixi run verify-gpu
```

Run repository commands through Pixi, for example:

```bash
pixi run inference
```

Downloaded model weights remain outside version control under `pretrained/`.
They can be fetched with `pixi run download-models` when needed.

With both the Wan backbone and released RynnWorld-4D weights in place, run one
BF16 training step on a single 32 GB GPU with ZeRO-3 CPU offload:

```bash
pixi run train-pretrained-smoke
```

The smoke task trains only the joint-attention parameters, writes TensorBoard
events under `outputs/pretrained-stage3-smoke-1step/`, and intentionally skips
the large final checkpoint. Override the output directory with
`RYNNWORLD_SMOKE_OUTPUT_DIR` if needed.

#### Conda / pip

We use anaconda or miniconda to manage the python environment:
```bash
conda create -n "rynnworld4d" python=3.10 -y
conda activate rynnworld4d
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

For the policy head (RynnWorld-4D-Policy), additionally:
```bash
cd rynnworld4d_policy && bash policy_env.sh && cd ..
```

### 📖 Pretrained Models

All pretrained models are placed under a single `pretrained/` directory:

```
RynnWorld-4D/
└── pretrained/
    ├── Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers/       # base video backbone (required)
    ├── RynnWorld-4D/                    # our released stage-3 checkpoint (optional)
    └── da3/                             # Depth-Anything-3 (required for policy only)
```

**1️⃣ Wan2.2-TI2V-5B** — the required base backbone for world-model training and inference.
```bash
huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers --local-dir ./pretrained/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers
```

**2️⃣ RynnWorld-4D released weights** (optional) — skip training and directly run inference / policy.
```bash
huggingface-cli download Alibaba-DAMO-Academy/RynnWorld-4D --local-dir ./pretrained/RynnWorld-4D
```

**3️⃣  Depth-Anything-3** (only for `RynnWorld-4D-Policy`) — on-device depth estimation at policy inference time.
```bash
huggingface-cli download depth-anything/Depth-Anything-3 --local-dir ./pretrained/da3
```

All training/inference scripts derive `PROJECT_ROOT` from their own location and reference these paths relative to it, so no further path edits are needed.

## 🏋️ World-Model Training

The world model is trained in **3 stages**. All scripts resolve `${PROJECT_ROOT}` from `$BASH_SOURCE`, so cloning the repo anywhere works as long as `pretrained/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers` is in place. The bundled `data/sample.json` lets you smoke-test each stage immediately.

### 1️⃣ Stage 1 — SFT (all branches warm-up)
Full-parameter SFT on RGB, depth, and optical flow without Joint Cross-modal Attention.
```bash
bash scripts/rynnworld4d-stage1.sh
```
- `--training_type sft`, `--fusion_mode none`
- output → `training/rynnworld4d-stage1/`

### 2️⃣ Stage 2 — Tri-branch RoPE
Switch to 3D RoPE positional encoding. Joint cross-modal attention starts from `--joint_start_layer 0`.
```bash
bash scripts/rynnworld4d-stage2.sh
```
- `--resume_from_stage1 <stage1_ckpt>`
- output → `training/rynnworld4d-stage2/`

### 3️⃣ Stage 3 — Tri-branch SFT
Full-parameter fine-tuning with joint attention. A cosine decay schedule gradually reduces the depth/flow→RGB injection from 1.0 to 0.0 over `--joint_video_decay_steps`, preventing cross-modal interference from degrading RGB quality while preserving depth/flow consistency.
```bash
bash scripts/rynnworld4d-stage3.sh
```
- `--load_stage2_model_weights <stage2_ckpt>`, `--joint_video_decay True`
- output → `training/rynnworld4d-stage3/`

## 🎬 World-Model Inference

```bash
python inference-sft.py \
  --model_path ./pretrained/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers \
  --checkpoint_path ./training/rynnworld4d-stage3/checkpoint-1000 \
  --json_path ./data/sample.json \
  --output_dir ./results/inference-sft \
  --num_inference_steps 50 \
  --guidance_scale 1.0
```

Outputs the three synchronized streams per sample:
```
<output_dir>/<sample_id>/
├── rgb.mp4              # generated RGB
├── depth.mp4            # generated depth
└── flow.mp4             # generated optical flow
```

## 🤖 RynnWorld-4D-Policy (Bimanual Manipulation)

RynnWorld-4D-Policy reuses the frozen world-model backbone as a 4D feature extractor and trains a lightweight flow-matching action head on top.

### Bundled sample data
3 episodes of Tianji Pick-Place are shipped under `data/tianji_sample/` (head video + parquet + metadata) and `data/tianji_sample_depth/` (matching depth videos), so the policy trainer works immediately after clone.

### Train
```bash
bash scripts/rynnworld4d-policy.sh
```
Before launching, point `pretrained_model_path` (Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers) and `rynnworld4d_ckpt` (your Stage-3 checkpoint) in `rynnworld4d_policy/policy_conf/train_config.yaml`.

The script auto-detects single vs multi-GPU and forwards extra args to `train.py` (Hydra-style):
```bash
# Override any config field on the CLI
bash scripts/rynnworld4d-policy.sh batch_size=4 max_epochs=100
```

### Serve / deploy
```bash
cd rynnworld4d_policy
python serve_rynnworld4d_policy.py --port 8099 --checkpoint <policy_ckpt>
```
The policy speaks the OpenPI websocket protocol; `smoke_test_serve.py` is a minimal client.

See [`rynnworld4d_policy/README.md`](rynnworld4d_policy/README.md) for the full policy training recipe and architectural details.
